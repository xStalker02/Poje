Changes:
- Rogue's marker stack now shows at 150 instead of 500 (Since 150 is like a chaos rn so why not)
- Maps of all tiers are shown (previous version had 10+ or something)
- Atoll and Strand are highlighted differently, as those are good for low tier essence/bestiary spam
- Added some weeb sounds on High tier 2 and God tier 2 currency
- Changed color of high tier 2 currency
- Added t6 (weeping) essence cuz idk
